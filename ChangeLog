   was implemented.

   was supported.

   were established.
 - Support for random register allocation was implemented.
 - Options '--comments-enabled' and '--comments-enabled' for enabling/disabling
   printing comments to test programs were added.
 - Option '--solver-debug' for enabling debug output of SMT solvers was added.
 - Functionality of the 'include' directive was improved.
 - Format of generated test programs was enhanced.
 - If a preparator for an addressing mode is not specified, test generation
   is aborted.
 - Several bug fixes and general improvements were made.

 2015/05/29 MicroTESK 2.2.3 beta

 The new build contains the following changes:

 - Test data is generated taking into account data generated for other
   instructions.
 - Statistics on test program size and test generator performance is collected.
 - Test programs are split into parts if they exceed the specified limits
   on instruction number.

 2015/05/22 MicroTESK 2.2.2 alpha

 The new build contains the following changes:

 - Simple mechanism for detecting loops in test templates was implemented. If
   the number of branch executions exceeds the specified limit, test generation
   is halted.
 - New attribute 'init' was supported for 'mode' and 'op' nML primitives. It
   specifies initialization actions to be performed each time before code
   of other standard attributes like 'syntax' and 'image' is executed.
 - The repetition operator was implemented in nML. Syntax is the following:
   {N}X - concatenates the specified location X with itself N times.
 - Branches of logic in nML specifications which raise exceptions are
   automatically marked as named test situations.
 - Syntax of the 'reg', 'mem' and 'var' nML constructs was extended to support
   array-based aliases.
 - Functionality of 'format' and 'trace' nML functions was improved. Now they
   support conditional string-based expressions as arguments.
 - Default values for some command-line options are now stored in
   a configuration file.
 - Several bug fixes and general improvements were made.

 2015/04/23 MicroTESK 2.2.1 alpha

 The new build contains the following changes:

 - Support for the CVC4 constraint solver
 - Several bug fixes and general code improvements

 2015/03/24 MicroTESK 2.2.0 alpha

 The new build contains the following changes:

 - Support for automated extraction of coverage information that allows building
   constraints for named instruction execution paths
 - Possibility to process test templates in a stream manner (block by block) 
   was implemented, which allows processing larger test templates
 - The "trace" method (test templates) now accepts objects created
   by the "rand" method
 - Several bug fixes and general improvements were made

 2014/03/20 MicroTESK 2.0.1 beta

 MicroTESK is an open-source framework for generating test programs for
 microprocessors. It is customized for a specific microprocessor architecture
 with formal specifications in nML/Sim-nML. Test programs are generated on a
 basis of test templates, which are abstract descriptions of test scenarios.
 Flexible and convenient Ruby-based test template language allows creating a
 wide range of tests (from random to directed) with minimal efforts.
