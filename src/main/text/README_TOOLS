To generate test data based on constraints, MicroTESK requires external
constraint solver engines. The current version uses the Z3 constraint solver
by Microsoft Research (http://z3.codeplex.com/). The Z3 executable should be
downloaded and placed to the <installation dir>/tools directory.

1. Windows users should download Z3 (32 or 64-bit version) from the following
   page: http://z3.codeplex.com/releases and unpack the archive to the
   <installation dir>/tools/z3/windows directory.
   Note: the executable file location is <windows>/z3/bin/z3.exe.

2. UNIX and Linux users should use one of the links below and and unpack the
   archive to the <installation dir>/tools/z3/unix directory.
   Note: the executable file location is <unix>/z3/bin/z3.exe.
