Installing Constraint Solvers

To generate test data based on constraints, MicroTESK requires external constraint solver engines. The current version uses the Z3 constraint solver by Microsoft Research (http://z3.codeplex.com/). The Z3 executable should be downloaded and placed to the <installation dir>/tools directory.

1. Windows users should download Z3 (32 or 64-bit version) from the following page: http://z3.codeplex.com/releases, unpack the archive and place the z3.exe file to the <installation dir>/tools/z3/windows directory.

2. UNIX and Linux users should use one of the links below and place the z3 executable file to the <installation dir>/tools/z3/unix/z3 directory.
